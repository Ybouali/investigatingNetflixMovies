## My first project as a data scientist

In this data science project, I investigate the evolving landscape of Netflix movies by analyzing trends in movie durations over time. Leveraging Python's powerful data manipulation and visualization libraries including pandas and matplotlib, I aim to answer a fundamental question: Are Netflix movies becoming shorter as the platform evolves?

Through a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) pipeline, I delve into a rich dataset encompassing Netflix movie metadata, exploring key metrics such as movie release dates and durations. By harnessing my skills in data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization, I uncover insights into the temporal evolution of movie durations on Netflix.

## Key Objectives:

# Data Acquisition and Preparation:
    - Collect and preprocess Netflix movie data, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    - Employ advanced data manipulation techniques with pandas to uncover patterns and distributions in movie durations.
# Statistical Analysis:
    - Apply statistical methods to quantify trends in movie lengths over different time periods.
# Data Visualization:
    - Utilize matplotlib to create informative visualizations that communicate trends and findings effectively.
# Insight Generation:
    - Draw meaningful conclusions from the analysis, shedding light on potential shifts in Netflix's content strategy.

This project not only showcases my proficiency in Python programming, data manipulation, and visualization but also demonstrates my ability to address real-world questions through rigorous data analysis. Join me on this journey of exploring the dynamic world of Netflix movies through the lens of data science!
